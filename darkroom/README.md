#### DARK ROOM

Small application using jQuery and CSS to test a "flashlight"-feature 
to reveal elements on a page. Also testing how elements can cast shadows
based on the cursor's position.
User controls a flashlight with the cursor and switches it on and off 
by clicking the mouse button.  
The flashlight is a bit messed up so it flickers randomly. 
Its battery will slowly drain while switched on, indicated by the icon in the top right
corner of the page.
