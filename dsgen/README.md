#### Dark Souls Challenge Build Generator

Rolls a random challenge build for a character in Dark Souls.  

Basically a set of tables containing class, weapon, off-hand, armor, magic and starting gift.  
Upon execution, the script rolls a random value from each table and inserts them into the HTML-element
with the given id (found in the array "prop").
